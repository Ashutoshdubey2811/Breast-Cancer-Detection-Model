# Breast Cancer Classification (Machine Learning)

This project uses various machine learning algorithms such as:
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes

The goal is to classify breast tumors as **Malignant** or **Benign** using the
Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Also it compares The algorithms and gives the best algorithm out of all.

This project is the modern and improvised version of the research done by By Jean Njoroge PhD named as:
" Using Predictive Analysis To Predict Diagnosis of a Breast Tumor "
